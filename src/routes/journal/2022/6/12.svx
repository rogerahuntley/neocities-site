This is a sneak preview of the site updates. Well, technically it's not even a preview *nor* is it a sneak -- these features are now live! I wanted to do some more documentation on them, but they ended up being a lot more time consuming / exhausting than I anticipated. Anyway, here's ~~wonderwall~~ some pictures.
