title: Updates to the site 2

<script>
  import Godot from '$lib/lexicon/Godot.svx';
  import GodotE from '$lib/examples/2022-6-5/example.svx';
</script>

I added some components that can be abstracted away and referenced in multiple places across the website -- right now this includes:

* Lexicon (info on Godot, GWJ, Itch)
* Lists (lists of related links I can drop anywhere)
* Contant Info

What's really nice about having these is that I can write them up in markdown using mdsvex, and by using front matter I can style that infomation using a mdsvex template.

Take this example, pulled from `Godot.svx`

```markdown
---
name: Godot
site: https://godotengine.org/
discord: https://discord.com/invite/4JBkykG
twitter: https://twitter.com/godotengine
---

Godot is a super-cool, lightweight, open-source game engine.
```

and this is pulled from '_lexicon.svelte'

```svelte
<script>
	export let name = null,
		site = null,
		discord = null,
		twitter = null;

	let hidden = true;

	const toggle = () => {
		hidden = !hidden;
	};
</script>

<button on:click={toggle}>{name}</button>
{#if !hidden}
	<aside>
		<a href={site}>website</a>
		<a href={discord}>discord</a>
		<a href={twitter}>twitter</a>
		<slot />
	</aside>
{/if}
```

which creates a component like you see here:

<GodotE />

Althought I may have made some changes since writing this article, so here's the updated version:

<Godot />

> Note: I went back and converted some existing content from previous articles into these components, turning these into "living" entries

## Style Updates

### CSS Features

So right now, the site looks kind of monkey. üçå

This is because I'm using a css lib ([the-new-css-reset](https://elad2412.github.io/the-new-css-reset/)) to clear all css styles. I was having issues with Safari where buttons and other elements looked completely different than expected. I was trying to override them, and when I went to look on my phone, the website looked completely different than it did on my Chrome Browser.

I knew I needed a solution. There have been files and libs to do this for ages (css versioning is tricky, but [*CSS3* dates back to pre-Y2k](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS20/)), but web browsers can do so much more now. the-new-css-reset is remarkably simple, and I like that simplicity. It also clears all css styles, making everything (buttons, links, etc) look like plain text. ü§Ø


So the site looks like plain-text until I specifically re-enable any css feature. I've already done so with a few elements: hx, button, pre tags -- but there's still a lot of work to do. My `app.css` now looks something like this:

```css
// generic stuff
html, body {
  height: 100%;
}

button {
  cursor: pointer;
}

pre {
  font-family: monospace;
  white-space: pre-wrap;
}

code {
  font-family: monospace;
  font-size: .8rem;
}

// header sizes lol
@for $i from 1 through 6 {
  h#{7 - $i} {
      font-size: calc(1.6rem / 6 * $i);
  }
}
```

### Media Queries

A huge part in making a website responsive is using media queries. For that, I'm using [include-media](https://www.npmjs.com/package/include-media) and [svelte-media-query](https://www.npmjs.com/package/svelte-media-query). The main section of code driving the website and its scale looks like this:

```css
:root {
  @include media("<tablet"){
    font-size: 6vmin;
  }
  @include media(">=tablet", "<desktop"){
    font-size: 4vmin;
  }
  @include media(">=desktop"){
    font-size: 2vh;
  }
}
```

When sizing things later, I resize elements and text by setting their value in `rem`s. Anything that depends on the size of nearby text (header padding, that sort of thing), I set their value in `em`s. A good writeup on the differences and why/how to use them is available [here](https://css-tricks.com/rem-global-em-local/).

Additionally, the site is currently responsive and laid out using [CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout). Grid is pretty cool for building out structures in more than one direction ([Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) changed my life, but you can't rely on `wrap` for everything), so I use it to build out the template for the header, nav, content, aside, footer. I can adjust this layout easily using [CSS Media Queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries) to other layouts that fit the content better.
