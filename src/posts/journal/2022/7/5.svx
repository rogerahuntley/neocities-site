Yesterday morning I woke up pretty early after a long night of hanging out with my friends. I would spend this independence day programming... But what to work on? Still holding [this](/journal/5/31) article in the back of my mind, and feeling good about the state of this site (there's only like, 3? new features in development üòâ), I decided to work on one of my existing Godot projects. I've been thinking a lot about Godot lately - I really want to dive back into game jams, and as soon as Godot 4 has it's first beta release I'm gonna be working on something in 3D. Anyway, I've opened intima-sea a few times before and with the intent to work on the writing, but this time I wanted to try diving into 2048 to add leaderboards.

The interesting thing about 2048 is that it was my first real Godot project. I made it to familiarize myself with the engine without having to design a whole lot, just to prove I could make something and quickly. For this reason, it's small and well-spirited, so it makes for a really good re-entry point as well. After looking through the code, I determined that I could definely do some maintainence - but it isn't broken, so let's not break it.

Here's a changelog of sorts:

1. Added Leaderboards from [silentwolf](https://silentwolf.com/) üôè
2. Converted audio to .wav, increased buffer - seemed to help with audio performance
3. Adjusted swipe detection script to work better on smaller screen and pulled it into a seperate plugin to use in other projects
4. Exported HTML5 version with scaling as viewport, it causes pixelation but performance is *much* better.

I deployed the new version to [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dog.steal.twozerofoureight), and uploaded the other versions to [itch.io](https://rogerahuntley.itch.io/2048). If I ever get a MacBook (hopefully this summer I'll pick up an M2 Air), I might work on a Linux, MacOS and iOS port. My other games don't have Google Play releases, but this app works *excellently* as a "get my feet wet" app, which makes it perfect for trying to deploy my first app to the Play Store. In future projects I probably won't bother with mobile app store releases unless at least a few of the following are true:

1. It's designed from the start for mobile
2. I can give it *serious attention* as a port
3. I'm addicted to it
4. It's really popular and I feel like I should monetize it
5. Someone else clones my repo and tries to upload it
6. Good fit for the platform and is also coming out on Steam?

The App Store is a pain and is meant to be taken seriously, and I'm not in the polish phase of my journey yet. I think that focusing on small games as learning exercises and hosting those experiments on Itch.io will mean they are available enough so that I can share it with friends, and simultanously stay accessible enough as a developer to not get too caught up in App Store mandates and documentation.
